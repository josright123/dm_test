Definitions of the driver configuration mode:

  d0 -- [DTS][INT] (default)
  d1 -- [DTS][POLL] (coerce)
  
  d2 -- [NDTS][INT] (coerce)
  d3 -- [NDTS][POLL] (coerce)
  
  DTS mode: 
	d0 interrupt, d1 polling 
  Non DTS mode: 
	d2 interrupt, d3 polling 
	
  In dm9051_release.c, default as d0  (default)
  
  In dm9051_d1.c, dm9051_d2.c, dm9051_d3.c, dm9051_olderkernel.c,
    The macro define, DM_TCONF_VER, is defined as 1,2,3 for d1,d2,d3.  (coerces)
